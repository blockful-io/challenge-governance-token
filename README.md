# Blockful Challenge - Governance APP

## Overview

This challenge involves building a complete governance system with token delegation functionality. You'll work with smart contracts, frontend development, and blockchain indexing to create a comprehensive governance solution.

## Challenge Requirements

### 1. Governance Token Implementation

Create a governance token that supports delegation:

- Use `ERC20Votes` or `ERC721Votes` from OpenZeppelin
- Implement proper delegation mechanics
- Include permit functionality for gasless approvals
- Ensure the token can be used for voting power delegation\

The governance token should:

- [ ] Inherit from `ERC20`, `ERC20Permit`, and `ERC20Votes` (or 721)
- [ ] Implement required function overrides

### 2. Event Indexing with Ponder

Use Ponder to index delegation events:

- Create database schema
- Index relevant events around delegation
- Real-time updates when new delegations occur

Schema considerations:

- Delegation entities with delegator/delegatee relationships
- Historical delegation data
- Event timestamps and block numbers

> **_Bonus Points:_**
>
> - Implement delegate removal functionality

### 3. Frontend Application

Build a user interface for token delegation:

- Display token balance and voting power
- Allow users to delegate their tokens to other addresses
- Show delegation history and current delegations
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

Key features:

- Transaction status feedback
- Error handling for failed transactions

> **_Bonus Points:_**
>
> - Add delegation historical chart
> - Real-time balance updates (relying on real time state management like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview))
